# kickstarter-analysis
## An Analysis of Global Fundraising Projects
##### Overview of Project

###### The purpose of this project was to analyze the success and failures of Kickstarter Projects launched around the world. The study takes place over several years for more accurate information. The projects were also broken down into categories for a better understanding of the data. 

##### Basic Analysis of Launch Time
###### It would appear that projects launched during the winter are not as successful as those launched in the *summer* months. 

##### Theater Category Analysis
###### Generally speaking, theater seemed to be one of the most successful categories. Projects that had realistic goals tended to be the most successful as well. Please see the chart below.

##### Summary
###### Overall, projects that had funding goals of $35000 to $45000 seem to be the most successful. Projects that request more than $45000 tend to be the least successful. Chart below is titled Outcomes Based on Goal.
